# HUFFMAN-ENCODING--DSA-Project
Huffman Coding is a C++ project that aims to efficiently compress bit strings and minimize the total code length of data by assigning variable-length codes based on symbol frequencies. The technique finds applications in compressing audio and image files, making it valuable for digital communication and image processing.
